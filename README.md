# Unlocking-PC-using-Face-Fecognition
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The traditional password-based or PIN-based method of unlocking personal computers has a number of drawbacks, such as the potential for forgotten passwords, susceptibility to unauthorized access, and inconvenience during regular use. The goal of this project is to create an OpenCV-based facial recognition-based system that enables users to unlock their PCs by presenting their faces in front.
